        <h4 class="uni">Bachelor's Degree <span class="year">sept 2016 - june 2020</span></h4>

        <p class="about-text">I received a Bachelor's Degree in history and archeology at the Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University with a high
        average grade in the diploma (192/200).</p>

        <h4 class="uni">Master's Degree <span class="year">sept 2020 - feb 2022</span></h4>

        <h4 class="uni">Exchange Programme <span class="year">sept 2019 - feb 2020</span></h4>
        
        <p class="about-text">I participated in the international student mobility program Erasmus +. I studied at the University of Ca`Foscari in

        reference letter from Professor Laura Cerasi after receiving the highest grade in the class (30/30).</p>

    <!-- Experience -->
    
    <div class="Experience">
        <h3 class="education">Experience</h3>

        <h4 class="uni">International Organizations</h4>

        <p class="about-text">While participating in the Erasmus + program, I joined the international Erasmus Student Network (ESN), of which I was a
        member from 2019 to 2020. During my membership in ESN, I participated in their events and promotions (student marches
        and climate companies).</p>

        <p class="about-text">In 2021, I was contacted by Democracy Reporting International (Germany) and offered to do an internship in local
        government in my city. During this period I passed an internship as the assistant-consultant of the deputy of the
        Mykolaiv city council - Yuriy Stepanets. At the end of the program, I decided to continue working as an
        assistant-consultant of the deputy.</p>

        <h4 class="uni" >Civic activity</h4>

        <p class="about-text">For the past 6 years I have been an active member of the Clio student corporations at Petro Mohyla Black Sea National
        University. Even after graduation, I continue to take an active part in the life of the student union and keep in touch
        with professors.</p>

        <p class="about-text">While studying at the university, I participated in many activities related to student life. First of all, I was an
        active participant in the "open day" at Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University, for which I received an award from
        the Dean of the Faculty of Political Science.</p>

        <p class="about-text">Since I was 18, I have been writing complaints and inquiries to local deputies about the quality of the city's public
        infrastructure. Five years later, I started working as an assistant-consultant for the deputy and I started receiving
        these complaints for further processing.</p>

        <p class="about-text">In 2021 I joined the Community Based Organization "MISTO 2050" which acts in the interests of the city of Mykolaiv. That
        same year, the organization nominated me as a candidate for the Mayor's Youth Council, where I was elected by the end of
        2021.</p>

        <p class="about-text">This year, the Mayor's Youth Council began its annual preparations for participation in the competition of the youth
        capital of Ukraine. Together with the members of the Mayor's Youth Council, I developed a program and concept of youth
        projects for the development of our city. Unfortunately, due to the war, initiatives and projects were frozen.</p>

        <p class="about-text">This year, I joined the public organization "National Association of Youth Advisors". The organization includes
        representatives of youth movements from all over Ukraine. In September 2022, we started dealing with organizational
        issues within our association. Currently, we have several projects planned at both the municipal and all-Ukrainian
        levels.</p>

        <h4 class="uni">Political activity</h4>

        <p class="about-text">Since the 2019 presidential election, I have been actively defending my political position and, as a member of civil
        society, I have voted in every election. In the parliamentary elections of the same 2019, I tried myself as an election
        observer for the first time.</p>

        <p class="about-text">In 2020, during the regional elections in Ukraine, I was appointed a representative of the press from the newspaper
        "NASHA HROMADA". I monitored the polling station and prevented any falsifications.</p>

        <p class="about-text">Working as a deputy's assistant-consultant, I gained extensive experience in working with documents and parliamentary
        activities. Often visiting the city council and seeing the work of party groups and the mayor, I set a goal to take an
        active part in the politics of the city, and later possibly the whole country.</p>

        <p class="about-text">Unfortunately, working in the Mayor's Youth Council, due to the lack of a deputy's rank, we could not influence the
        Mayor's decision, but we could advise. Our advice was quite valuable and therefore it is not uncommon for projects
        related to the city's youth policy to be implemented jointly by us together with the deputies.</p>

        <p class="about-text">Every year, starting in 2018, I publish my articles on the basis of the All-Ukrainian scientific conference "Mohyla

        Fedkovych National University and V. Dahl National University)</p>

        cultural development of the city of Mykolaiv.</p>

        <p class="about-text">As an active student during my studies, I received several reference letters from both Ukrainian and Italian professors.</p>
